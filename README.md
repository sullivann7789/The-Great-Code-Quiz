### Things to know about CSS and styling:

When working on this project, as the creator, I decided that I would like to create a simplified,
unique, and eye-catching aesthetic that had a modern taste. This is because I believe it is important for the user,
particularly in a test-setting, to find themselves in an appealing visual program that doesn't cause to0 much distraction beyond the task;
While also initiating a sense of interest and positive mental association with the program through balanced visual stimulation.
